### Description;
This is webpage that helps customers to order pizza and get it delivered to their place or pick it by themselves.
This  webpage is designed to take user input for a pizza. This page has a header for the name of the company, a form for 
various parts of the pizza, such as toppings and size of pizza, and a submit button for the pizza, which will 
then reveal the user's cart. As the user adds more pizzas the cart reflects their order and their cart total 
increases with the pizza prices. At the bottom of the cart there is a button to submit your cart order. When you 
submit your order you can choose between Take Out and Delivery. Delivery adds $10 to the cost of the order. If the
user clicks on Take Out, it asks for the pickup person's name. Then it will show a message for when to pick up 
their order and button to Order More. Clicking Order More resets the page. If the user clicks the Delivery button,
their total increases by 10 and a form appears for their name and address. After submitting their info, a page will
appear confirming their information and a expected time for their delivery. The Order More button will appear and 
if they click on it, it resets the page.
